                                            The last phase involves intensive
                                            development. We make improvements on
                                            the product based on the feedback
                                            received from user testing. This
                                            phase is designed to completely
                                            finish the product so that it is
                                            ready to be delivered to the
                                            nonprofit. Upon completion, we meet
                                            with the nonprofit to hand off the
                                            product and to figure out how
                                            maintenance of the product is to be
                                            handled.

                                        community? We prefer projects that will
                                        provide the maximal benefit to the
                                        target community.

                                        complete the project? We want to ensure
                                        that we are helping organizations that
                                        truly need our services.

                                        that we can finish the project and
                                        deliver quality results within a

                                        Does your project use the capabilities

                                        team's areas of expertise?

                                        an impact? We like to see evidence that
                                        supports this! We also prefer to work
                                        with non-profits that have a proven
                                        track record of doing good.
